In the Redux dev tools, the "api/config/middlewareregistered" entry refers to the process
of registering middleware with the Redux store. Middleware is a way to intercept and
modify actions before they reach the store's reducer, and can be used to perform tasks
such as logging, handling asynchronous actions, or routing. When middleware is registered
with the store, it will be notified of all actions dispatched to the store and will have
the opportunity to modify or cancel the actions before they reach the reducer. 
This entry in the dev tools is a way to see which middleware has been registered with 
the store and in what order.
