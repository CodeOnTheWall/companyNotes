User logs in via login mutation func inside Login component
this login mutation func sends username and password to authApiSlice as credentials
its the authApiSlice since we have to interact with backend api to receive the aT from route /authApiSlice   

SEE authFlow inside backend authController 

now we get the aT back from backend authController, and can set the state with that aT
from Login component, we dispatch aT to the setCredentials func inside authSlice 
and authSlice because this info is only needed on front end now, and authSlice will
set the state with that aT
